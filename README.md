# 🟣 Anony Talk – Anonymous Platform for Mental Health

Anony Talk is a safe and anonymous platform designed to give people the freedom to express their emotions, struggles, and thoughts without fear of judgment.  
The project’s main purpose is to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and to provide a supportive space where individuals can feel heard, understood, and valued.

## 🌟 Why Anony Talk?
Mental health issues like stress, trauma, grief, and anxiety often go unspoken due to fear of judgment and lack of safe spaces.  
Anony Talk changes this by providing an anonymous environment where users can openly share their feelings, relate to others, and seek motivation without revealing their identity.
